# Phase 0 · Chapter 0.3: Loops and Controlled Repetition

A loop is an instruction that says: "Repeat these steps until something changes."

That's all it is.

No magic. No intelligence. Just repetition with a stopping condition.

## Why Loops Exist

Computers are fast, but they are dumb.

Loops exist so you don't have to:
- Rewrite the same instruction 1,000 times
- Predict how many times something needs to happen
- Manually track progress

Instead, you say:
- "Keep going while this is true"
- Or "repeat this for each item"
- Or "stop when this condition is met"

---

## Every Loop Has Three Parts

This is critical. Burn it in.

Every loop contains:
1. A starting state
2. A condition to keep going
3. A change to state that eventually ends the loop

If any one of these is missing, you get:
- An infinite loop
- A loop that never runs
- A loop that stops too early

Loops don't fail randomly. They fail structurally.

---

## Loops Are Conditions Over Time

A loop is not a new idea.

It's just:
- A condition
- Checked repeatedly
- While state changes

That's it.

Same condition. Different moment in time.

---

## Where Loops Are Used

Everywhere:
- Reading sensor data repeatedly
- Waiting for a button press
- Iterating over files
- Polling a network
- Running a game loop
- Keeping a server alive

If something feels "alive," it's almost always a loop.

---

## Reflection

Think about:
- Checking your mirrors while driving
- Monitoring battery voltage
- Waiting for water to boil

You're looping mentally.

Humans do this naturally. Computers must be told explicitly.

---

## Understanding Check

You should be able to say:

"A loop repeats instructions while a condition remains true, and every loop must have a starting state, a condition, and a state change that eventually ends it."

If that feels solid, you're ready for the next chapter on functions.
