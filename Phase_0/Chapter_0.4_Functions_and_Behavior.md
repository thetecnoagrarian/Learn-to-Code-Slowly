# Phase 0 · Chapter 0.4: Functions and Naming Behavior

Up until now, everything we've talked about has been about what the computer does.

Functions are the first concept that exists mostly for humans.

A function is a named group of instructions.

That's the whole idea.

Not a new capability. Not a new kind of logic. Just a name wrapped around behavior.

## Why Functions Exist at All

Computers do not need functions.

They are perfectly happy executing one long list of instructions from top to bottom.

Humans are not.

Without functions:
- Programs become unreadable
- Intent disappears
- Small mistakes hide inside large blobs of logic

Functions exist to let you say: "This set of instructions represents one idea."

## What a Function Really Does

A function:
- Has a name
- Contains instructions
- May accept inputs
- May return outputs
- Always runs in sequence, just like any other instructions

Nothing inside a function breaks the rules you already learned.

Inside a function:
- State is read
- State is changed
- Conditions branch
- Loops repeat

A function is not a shortcut around thinking. It is a label on thinking you already did.

## Naming Is the Real Skill

The hardest part of functions is not writing them. It's naming them.

A good function name:
- Describes what happens, not how
- Matches how a human would explain the behavior
- Makes the code readable without comments

Employers look at function names before logic.

Bad names signal confusion. Clear names signal understanding.

## Reflection

While driving or working, think about this:

If you had to explain your generator startup process to someone else:
- Where would you group steps?
- What would you name each group?

Those groupings are functions. You already do this mentally.

## Understanding Check

You should be able to say:

"A function is a named group of instructions that helps humans understand behavior."

If that sentence feels stable, you're ready for the next chapter on data and variables.
