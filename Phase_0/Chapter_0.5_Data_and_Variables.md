# Phase 0 · Chapter 0.5: Data and Variables

Programs do not work with ideas. They do not work with meaning.

They work with data.

Everything a program sees, stores, checks, or changes is data.

## What Data Is

Data is information in a form the computer can handle.

Examples:
- A number representing temperature
- A word or message
- A true or false value
- A list of readings
- A structured record of values

No matter how complex a system feels, it is always built from simple data pieces.

## Variables Are Memory With Names

A variable is a name that points to a piece of data.

That's all it is.

It lets the program:
- Remember something
- Refer to it later
- Change it over time

Variables are state.

When people say: "I lost track of what's happening," what they usually lost track of is variables.

---

## Data Has Shape, Not Just Value

This part is critical and often skipped.

Data is not just "a thing." It has shape.

Examples:
- One temperature value
- A list of temperatures
- A table of timestamps and values
- A message with multiple fields

Most bugs come from assuming the wrong shape.

The value might be correct. The structure might not be.

---

## Reflection

While driving or working, think about your systems:
- What data exists?
- What data changes?
- What data is remembered?
- What data is temporary?

If you can name the data, you can program the system.

## Understanding Check

You should be able to say:

"Programs operate on data stored in variables that represent state."

If that feels solid, you're ready for the next chapter on errors and failure.
