# Phase 0 · Chapter 0.8: Consolidation and the Complete Mental Model

Here is the full mental model, stated cleanly.

---

## The Whole System

A program:
- Operates on data
- Stored in variables
- Representing state

It:
- Executes instructions in sequence
- Uses conditions to choose paths
- Uses loops to repeat work
- Groups behavior into functions

Over time:
- Inputs arrive
- State changes
- Outputs are produced
- Errors occur when assumptions break

Languages do not change this. Frameworks do not replace this. This is programming.

---

## Reduced Further

Say this slowly:

Inputs and state go in. Instructions run in order. Conditions choose paths. Loops repeat steps. State changes. Outputs appear.

That is programming.

## What You're Actually Learning

You are not learning:
- Python
- JavaScript
- C
- Frameworks

You are learning how machines process change over time.

Languages only give you syntax to express this.

## Why This Transfers to Jobs

A junior dev who understands this:
- Can debug
- Can reason about systems
- Can explain failures
- Can learn new stacks fast

A junior dev who skips this:
- Memorizes patterns
- Breaks things mysteriously
- Struggles outside tutorials

Employers can tell the difference.

## Final Anchor

Say this until it feels boring:

**A program is a sequence of instructions that transforms data and state over time using conditions, loops, and functions.**

If that sentence feels obvious, Phase 0 worked.

---

## Self-Assessment

You should be able to explain, without hesitation:
1. What a program is
2. What state means
3. Why instruction order matters
4. What a condition does
5. Why loops must change state
6. Why functions exist
7. How data relates to variables
8. What errors represent
9. Why timing matters

If any of those feel fuzzy, re-read the relevant chapter. That's not failure—that's reinforcement.

## What's Next

Phase 0 gave you the conceptual foundation. Phase 1 will express these same ideas in Python, showing you how to write code that embodies these mental models.

The physics don't change. Only the wiring harness.
