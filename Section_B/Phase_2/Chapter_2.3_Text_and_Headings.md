# Phase 2.5 · Chapter 2.5.3: Text and Headings

Headings (h1–h6); paragraphs; line breaks; horizontal rules; semantic hierarchy and accessibility.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use h1–h6 for heading hierarchy; one h1 per page; logical order.
- Mark up paragraphs with p; avoid br for paragraph spacing.
- Use br and hr where semantically appropriate (line break vs thematic break).
- Relate heading hierarchy to outline and screen readers.

---

## 1) Headings h1–h6

- [Expand: headings define sections and hierarchy; h1 = top-level, h2 sub, etc.]
- [Expand: one h1 per page (or per main landmark); don’t skip levels (e.g. h2 then h4).]
- [Expand: headings are not for "big text"—use CSS for size; use headings for structure.]

---

## 2) Paragraphs

- [Expand: <p> for blocks of text; block-level; margins by default.]
- [Expand: don’t use multiple <br> to simulate paragraphs; use multiple p elements.]
- [Expand: empty p is valid but usually unnecessary.]

---

## 3) Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules

- [Expand: <br>—line break within flow (e.g. address, poem); use sparingly.]
- [Expand: <hr>—thematic break between sections; visual separator.]
- [Expand: both are void elements; no closing tag in HTML5.]

---

## 4) Semantic Hierarchy and Accessibility

- [Expand: screen readers use headings to navigate; outline is derived from heading levels.]
- [Expand: good hierarchy improves SEO and comprehension.]
- [Expand: homestead example: h1 "Dashboard", h2 "Sensors", h3 per sensor group.]

---

## Summary

- Use h1–h6 for real structure; one h1; don’t skip levels. Use p for paragraphs, br/hr only when appropriate.
- Heading hierarchy supports outline and accessibility; keep it logical.
