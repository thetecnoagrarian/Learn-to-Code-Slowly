# Phase 4 · Chapter 4.19: Building a Dashboard Layout

Consolidation chapter. Assembling Flexbox, Grid, typography, spacing, and responsive patterns into a cohesive homestead monitoring dashboard. Bridge to Phase 5 (Shoelace components).

---

## Learning Objectives

- Assemble a dashboard: header (nav), main (grid of cards), optional sidebar; use Grid for page layout, Flexbox for components.
- Apply typography (rem, hierarchy), spacing (gap, variables), and color (status, theme variables) from previous chapters.
- Make it responsive: stack on small screens; grid or columns on large; same content, different layout.
- Prepare for Phase 5: structure and CSS ready for dropping in Shoelace components (or keep custom).

## 1) Page Structure

- [Expand: grid-template-areas: header, main (and optional sidebar), footer; or flex column with main growing.]
- [Expand: header: flex; justify-content space-between; align-items center; nav links.]
- [Expand: main: grid of cards or flex wrap; gap; card = flex column or block with padding.]

---

## 2) Typography and Spacing

- [Expand: --space-*, --font-* from variables; headings in rem; card title and value hierarchy.]
- [Expand: gap between cards; padding inside cards; margin between sections.]
- [Expand: consistent with Phase 4.11 and 4.15.]

---

## 3) Responsive Behavior

- [Expand: mobile: single column; full-width cards; nav as row or hamburger (concept).]
- [Expand: tablet/desktop: 2–3 column grid; sidebar if used.]
- [Expand: use media queries and possibly container queries (brief) for card grid.]

---

## 4) Bridge to Phase 5

- [Expand: Phase 5: Shoelace provides buttons, cards, inputs; your layout (grid, spacing) stays; replace or wrap with components.]
- [Expand: dashboard structure (header, main, cards) works with custom CSS or Shoelace; same mental model.]
- [Expand: homestead: sensor dashboard ready for Phase 5 polish or as-is.]

---

## Summary

- Dashboard: Grid/Flex layout; typography and spacing from variables; responsive; ready for Phase 5 components.

## Bridge / Next

Phase 4 complete. Next: **Phase 4.5 — DOM and Browser JavaScript** or **Phase 5 — Web Components (Shoelace)** (per path).

*Expansion note for ChatGPT: One full dashboard structure (HTML outline + CSS outline). Target ~150 lines.*
