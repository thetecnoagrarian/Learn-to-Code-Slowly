# Phase 4 · Chapter 4.5: Display and Layout Flow

block, inline, inline-block. Normal flow. How elements stack and wrap. Foundation for Flexbox and Grid.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Use display: block (stack vertically, full width); inline (flow with text, no width/height); inline-block (flow + box).
- Understand normal flow: block and inline flow; no flex/grid yet.
- Know why inline elements ignore top/bottom margin and height; use inline-block when you need box behavior in flow.
- Set foundation for Flexbox (Chapter 4.6) and Grid (4.7).

---

## 1) block, inline, inline-block

- [Expand: block: new line, width 100% by default; div, p, section.]
- [Expand: inline: no line break; width by content; span, a; margin/padding horizontal only effective.]
- [Expand: inline-block: inline flow but full box model; use for buttons in line, icons.]

---

## 2) Normal Flow

- [Expand: block elements stack; inline elements wrap in lines; no overlap (unless float/position).]
- [Expand: document order and flow determine layout before flex/grid.]
- [Expand: understanding flow helps debug when flex/grid change it.]

---

## 3) When to Use Which

- [Expand: block for sections, cards; inline for text-level (strong, span); inline-block for "inline but with padding/height."]
- [Expand: flex and grid override flow for children; display still matters for the container.]
- [Expand: homestead: nav items often inline-block or flex; content sections block.]

---

## 4) Foundation for Flex and Grid

- [Expand: display: flex and display: grid create new formatting context; children participate in flex or grid layout.]
- [Expand: block/inline/inline-block are the default; flex/grid are the next step for layout.]
- [Expand: next chapters: flex for 1D, grid for 2D.]

---

## Summary

- block, inline, inline-block; normal flow; use display to control stacking and wrapping; foundation for flex/grid.

*Expansion note for ChatGPT: One example each for block and inline-block. Target ~150 lines.*
