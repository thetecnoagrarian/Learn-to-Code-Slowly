# Phase 4 · Chapter 4.6: Flexbox — One-Dimensional Layout

flex container and flex items. Main axis and cross axis. justify-content, align-items, flex-grow, flex-shrink. Building flexible component layouts. Dashboard panels, sensor cards, nav bars.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Create a flex container with display: flex; understand main axis (flex-direction) and cross axis.
- Use justify-content (main axis) and align-items (cross axis); use gap for spacing.
- Use flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis (and shorthand flex) to control item sizing.
- Build nav bar, card row, or dashboard panel with flexbox.

---

## 1) Container and Axes

- [Expand: display: flex on parent; children become flex items; flex-direction: row (default) or column.]
- [Expand: main axis = direction of flow; cross axis = perpendicular; justify = main, align = cross.]
- [Expand: flex-wrap: wrap when items overflow.]

---

## 2) justify-content and align-items

- [Expand: justify-content: flex-start, center, flex-end, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.]
- [Expand: align-items: stretch, flex-start, center, flex-end, baseline.]
- [Expand: gap: space between items; replaces margin hacks.]

---

## 3) flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis

- [Expand: flex: 1 = grow to fill; flex: 0 0 200px = don't grow/shrink, basis 200px.]
- [Expand: flex-grow: 1 and flex-shrink: 0 common for "take remaining space."]
- [Expand: shorthand flex: grow shrink basis; flex: 1 1 0% = equal flex items.]

---

## 4) Dashboard and Nav Examples

- [Expand: nav: display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center.]
- [Expand: card row: display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; cards flex: 1 1 200px.]
- [Expand: homestead: sensor cards in a row; dashboard header with title and actions.]

---

## Summary

- Flex: container (display: flex, direction, wrap); justify/align; flex items (grow, shrink, basis); gap for spacing.
- Use for nav, card rows, and one-dimensional layouts.
